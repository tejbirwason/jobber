We serve hundreds of self-funded plan sponsors across 1000+ employers, representing over 4 million people across the U.S. We've saved our clients over $700 million since we were founded!

We understand and have experienced the challenges of navigating specialized healthcare and we are dedicated to making a change.



EDH is the market leader for Independent Centers of Excellence (CoE). We have challenged the status quo in healthcare by bringing top quality surgeons within reach of all. Our surgeon-first model is the largest and most accessible network (3-4x larger than our peers), which has delivered an ROI 3x our peers. We serve hundreds of self-funded plan sponsors across 1000+ employers, representing over 4 million people across the U.S. We've saved our clients over $700 million since we were founded!



Ultimately, the US healthcare system at-large is flawed. Costs continue to rise while life expectancy stagnates. We are moving the needed on this problem by improving surgery outcomes - making people healthier - and lowering healthcare costs at the same time.
